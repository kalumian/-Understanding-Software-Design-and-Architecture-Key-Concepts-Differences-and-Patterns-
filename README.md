# Software Design and Architecture for Non-Functional Requirements Solutions

## Software Design

### **Definition**
Software design represents the first stage of the Software Design Lifecycle. It involves defining:  
- How individual modules and components of the system will be designed.  
- Detailed software properties.  
- Specifications to help developers implement the software.  
- How components, modules, and functions will be built and interact.  

### **Characteristics of High-Quality Software Design**
To produce high-quality software, the design should exhibit these characteristics:  
1. **Correctness:** The ability to implement all software requirements accurately.  
2. **Understandability:** Easy to understand for all stakeholders, including developers and maintainers.  
3. **Efficiency:** Optimized use of resources and processes.  
4. **Maintainability:** Easy to modify and adapt with clear access to components and quick identification of changes.

## Software Architecture

### **Definition**
Software architecture is the highest level of software design and focuses on:  
- **Defining elements and components:** Identifying the necessary system components.  
- **Component interactions:** Specifying how components will interact with each other.  
- **Environmental considerations:** Determining the operating environment for the software.  

It defines the overall structure and constraints that guide software developers and includes documentation, charts, diagrams, and any tools used to communicate with stakeholders.

## Difference Between Software Design and Software Architecture

### **Software Design**
- Focuses on the individual modules and components of the software.  

### **Software Architecture**
- Focuses on the overall structure that integrates these components.

## Software Architecture Patterns

Software architecture patterns are **common solutions to recurring problems** in software development, particularly for addressing **non-functional requirements**. Examples include:  
1. **Serverless Architecture:** Leveraging cloud services to execute functions without managing servers, addressing scalability and cost efficiency.  
2. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Designing the system to respond to and process events as they occur, enhancing responsiveness and decoupling components.  
3. **Microservices Architecture:** Breaking the application into small, independently deployable services, improving modularity and fault isolation.

## Design Patterns

A **software design pattern** describes a problem, a solution, and when to apply it. It also provides hints and examples.  
Design patterns are categorized into:  
1. **Creational Patterns:** Focus on object creation mechanisms.  
2. **Structural Patterns:** Deal with object composition and structure.  
3. **Behavioral Patterns:** Define communication between objects.  

---

## Summary

- **Software Design:** Focuses on the specifics of components and their implementation.  
- **Software Architecture:** Focuses on the overarching system structure and component interaction.  

Both are critical for producing high-quality software that meets **functional and non-functional requirements**, such as:  
- Scalability  
- Maintainability  
- Performance  
- Modularity  
- Fault tolerance
